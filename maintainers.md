Hi!

Super exciting to have you here!

&nbsp;

#### So, what do I do?

You can contribute in the following ways:

- Documentation

- Add your ideas to [the roadmap](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/blob/master/roadmap.md)

- Replying to open issues

- Reviewing pull requests

- Add features that you think are useful! (make sure you read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first)

- Spreading bundlesize by adding it to an open source library that you like

&nbsp;

#### Okay, I've picked something

Assign it to yourself and mark it as "work in progress" so that others don't pick it up too! Feel free to discuss your approach on the issue before starting implementation ðŸ™‚

&nbsp;

#### Umm, yeah so how does bundlesize work?

Read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get acquainted.
If you think, there is something else that should be mentioned in it, raise an issue and I'll add it :smile:

&nbsp;

#### Take care of yourself!

Don't work too much! Contribute when you feel like. If you feel overwhelmed, ask for help or take a break!

Feel free to add me to your repositories when you need help ðŸ™‚
